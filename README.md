# FuzzyEtEPy

**FuzzyEtEPy** is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that provides a reusable Python-based end-to-end solution for creating, simulating, and training Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs).  
The workflow includes data normalization, correlation-based weight matrix creation from historical data, and tools for visualizing and simulating multi-layer FCMs.

The example Excel data files attached and referenced in the notebooks were created as part of the following master’s thesis case study:
